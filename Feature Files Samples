Feature: Sell Shares from User Portfolio

  Scenario: Verify calculation of prices per share, quantity, and total sales amount
    
    Given the user has shares in their portfolio with the following details:
      | Ticker | Quantity | Price per Share |
      | AAPL   | 50       | 150             |
      | TSLA   | 30       | 700             |

    When the user decides to sell a portion of their shares
      | Ticker | Quantity to Sell |
      | AAPL   | 20               |
      | TSLA   | 10               |

    Then the system should update the user's portfolio to show the remaining shares
      | Ticker | Remaining Quantity |
      | AAPL   | 30                 |
      | TSLA   | 20                 |

    And the system should calculate the total sales amount correctly as follows:
      | Ticker | Quantity Sold | Price per Share | Total Sales Amount |
      | AAPL   | 20            | 150             | 3000               |
      | TSLA   | 10            | 700             | 7000               |

    And the system should display the total sales amount as $10,000
