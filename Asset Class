Shares
When you sell shares, the sale price of the lot is calculated by multiplying the number of shares by the market price per share at the time of the sale, and then subtracting any applicable fees (e.g., brokerage commissions).

Formula:

Sale Price = ( Number of Shares × Market Price per Share ) − Fees 

Bonds
For bonds, the sale price of a lot is calculated by multiplying the face value of the bond by the sale price expressed as a percentage of the face value, and then subtracting any fees.

Formula:

Sale Price = (Face Value × Sale Price Percentage 100 )  − Fees

Mutual Funds
When you sell mutual fund shares, the sale price of the lot is calculated by multiplying the number of shares by the Net Asset Value (NAV) per share at the time of the sale, and then subtracting any fees.

Formula: Sale Price = (Number of Shares × NAV per Share ) − Fees

Example Calculations
Shares

If you sell 100 shares at a market price of $55 per share with a $10 fee:

Sale Price = (100×55)−10 = 5500−10 = 5490

Bonds
If you sell a bond with a face value of $1000 at 101% of its face value with a $15 fee:

Sale Price = (1000 ×1.01)−15 = 1010−15 = 995

Mutual Funds

If you sell 300 mutual fund shares at an NAV of $45 per share with a $20 fee:
Sale Price = ( 300×45 )− 20 = 13500 −20 = 13480
